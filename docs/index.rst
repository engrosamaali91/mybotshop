    Digital Twin-Driven Safety Protocol Development for HRI in German Retail Stores's <self>

Autonomous mobile robots are becoming increasingly intelligent through the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These robots are now capable of making real-time decisions, such as determining optimal paths, navigating around obstacles, and dynamically choosing new routes. With advanced sensors like LiDAR and cameras, robots can detect and respond to both stationary and moving objects, ensuring the safety of people, themselves, and the surrounding environment.

However, to operate safely and effectively, robots must adhere to strict safety protocols and comply with data protection regulations when interacting with humans. This is crucial to minimize risks, especially when deploying autonomous robots in settings such as retail stores or warehouses. Without thorough testing, there is a risk of accidents, injuries, or inventory damage. As a result, authorities have established safety regulations to ensure that robots are designed with compliance in mind.

To address these challenges, MYBOTSHOP is investing significant time and resources into training students to test and validate safety protocols and data protection policies for both new and existing robots within simulation environments. These simulated tests ensure that robots can be safely deployed in real-world scenarios without jeopardizing human lives or privacy.
