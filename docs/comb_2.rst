Combination 2: NavFn Planner + MPPI Controller
==============================================

This configuration utilizes the **NavFn Planner** for global path planning and the **MPPI (Model Predictive Path Integral) Controller** for local trajectory optimization. This combination is designed to balance efficiency, smoothness, and dynamic obstacle handling.

Why MPPI Controller is a Good Choice
-------------------------------------

The **MPPI Controller** is well-suited for dynamic environments requiring real-time adjustments. It optimizes trajectories by considering the robotâ€™s dynamics and environmental constraints, making it highly effective for:

- **Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance**: Evaluates multiple trajectories to select the optimal path while avoiding collisions.
- **Smooth Path Generation**: Produces jerk-free motions for stable operations.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Delivers responsive and efficient control in dynamic scenarios.
