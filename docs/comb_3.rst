Combination 3: NavFn Planner + Regulated Pure Pursuit Controller
================================================================

This configuration utilizes the **NavFn Planner** for global path planning and the **Regulated Pure Pursuit Controller** for local trajectory adjustments. While this combination is highly efficient for straight-line movements, its performance diminishes when navigating through close proximities or dynamic environments.

Why Regulated Pure Pursuit Controller is a Good Choice
-------------------------------------------------------

The **Regulated Pure Pursuit Controller** is known for its simplicity and reliability in following global paths, particularly in open environments. It is designed to scale its velocity based on proximity to obstacles and path curvature, ensuring smooth and precise motion.

**Key Advantages**:
- **Ideal for Straight-Line Movements**: Ensures smooth and predictable navigation without significant path deviations.
- **Velocity Regulation**: Dynamically adjusts speed to maintain safety when approaching obstacles.
- **Ease of Tuning**: Fewer parameters compared to more complex controllers, simplifying configuration.

Conclusion
----------

The combination of **NavFn Planner** and **Regulated Pure Pursuit Controller** is well-suited for open environments with minimal obstacles. However, its limitations become evident in more complex scenarios, such as navigating through tight spaces or reacting to dynamic obstacles.

**Future Improvements**:
- Consider using **DWB** or **MPPI** for environments with close proximities or high dynamic activity.
- Fine-tune parameters like `lookahead_dist` and enable **velocity-scaled lookahead** for more responsive adjustments.
