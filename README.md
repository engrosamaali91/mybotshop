# Assemble a Custom Robot in ISAAC Sim
Connect rigid bodies using joints, add a joint drive to control the joints, turn a chain of joints into an articulation, and control the robot using an Articulation Velocity Controller. [Step by step guide](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/gui_tutorials/tutorial_gui_simple_robot.html#isaac-sim-app-tutorial-gui-simple-robot:~:text=a%20Simple%20Robot-,Assemble%20a%20Simple%20Robot,%EF%83%81,-Omniverse%20Isaac%20Sim%E2%80%99s)

# Add Camera and Sensors
After assembling a custom robot learn how to attach a camera. Isaac Sim provides a variety of sensors that can be used to sense the environment and robotâ€™s state.
